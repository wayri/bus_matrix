# bus_matrix

This is a simple C++ console application which generates a bus admittance matrix.
it takes input from user and feeds it into the matrix. The dimensions of the matrix are obtained from the user input. 

The code contains multiple implementations that can be used for purposes other than its own like, generating a 2D vector 
at runtime based on user input, implementing a menu function and the ability of the program to take internally defined
commands into account.
